# Movies_Data_Knowledge_Graph_Implementation

### This is a python notebook covering all the necessary code to implement Knowledge graph in Python with any attributed sentences. In this case movies have been analysed to see the realtionship betweeen x1 and x2 nodes (one x value a.k.a feature with another x value). This analysis has been done in this case for Movie dataset taken from Wikipedia. It generally helps in improving the accuracy of the prediction , but is yet under exploration for research related work.
